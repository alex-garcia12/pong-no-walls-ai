# pong-no-walls-ai

This was a variation of the original Atari game of Pong. This rendition of the game is meant to have the player control multiple paddles (both a vertical and horizontal paddle) to defend themselves on all sides (on their side of the field) from the incoming ball from the opposing player. Additionally, this project is meant to have a working AI player to play against. 

This project was written in Python, using the PyCharm IDE. This project was meant to be a variation of Pong, but the new intended features were not implemented, and the result more closely resembles original Pong, where 2 players bounce the ball back and forth. This was one of my first exposures to using Python, and I'm happy with the result despite how simple the game appears.

============================================================================== 

Works

-2 players can play; each player controls their own paddles.

-Ball smoothly bounces back and forth; collision works on both player paddles and the top/bottom "walls"

-Score tracking has been implemented for each player. Game ends then restarts when one player has reached the score to win.


==============================================================================

Doesn't Really Work

-Top/Bottom paddles were not implemented

-AI player was not implemented. As a result, the intended speed/difficulty the player would be able to change in the main menu was not implemented.
